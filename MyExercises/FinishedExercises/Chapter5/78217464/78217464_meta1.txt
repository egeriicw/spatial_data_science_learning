The NED provides the best available public domain raster elevation data of the conterminous United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and territorial islands in a seamless format.  The NED is derived from diverse source data, processed to a common coordinate system and unit of vertical measure.  All NED data are distributed in geographic coordinates in units of decimal degrees, and in conformance with the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83).  All elevation values are provided in units of meters, and are referenced to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88) over the conterminous United States.  The vertical reference will vary in other areas.  NED data are available nationally at resolutions of 1 arc-second (approx. 30 meters) and 1/3 arc-second (approx. 10 meters), and in limited areas at 1/9 arc-second (approx. 3 meters).  At present, the bulk of Alaska is only available at a 2 arc-second (approx. 60 meters) resolution, owing to a lack of higher resolution source data, though some areas are available at resolutions of 1 and 1/3 arc-second with plans for significant upgrades of the state over the next five years.  The NED is updated on a nominal two month cycle to integrate newly available, improved elevation source data.    Purpose: The NED serves as the elevation layer of The National Map, and provides basic elevation information for earth science studies and mapping applications in the United States.  The data are utilized by the scientific and resource management communities for global change research, hydrologic modeling, resource monitoring, mapping and visualization applications.    Supplemental_Information: The data obtained through The National Map Seamless Server is considered to be the "best available" data from the USGS.  Historical data and other data may be obtained by contacting Customer Service, Earth Resources Observation & Science (EROS) Center at 1-800-252-4547.

The original tifs were converted to Arc grids, projected to Geographic Coordinate System North America NAD1983, and the data pixel size was resampled to 1/9th arc second.  The grids were then mosaicked together.  A shapefile was generated from the original data extent using the IsNull function to generate the dataset's footprint.         The final DEM and shaded-relief products were then generated.  Data inspection was performed by reviewing the hill shaded to detecting irregularities in the data.  The data were then loaded into ArcSDE to be made available for public access download.        Metadata was created for display through The National Map Seamless Server at http://seamless.usgs.gov, and is available in several formats: HTML, TEXT, XML, FAQ and SGML.
