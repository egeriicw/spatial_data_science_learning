    Description:
      Abstract:
        This map layer portrays the spread, by year, of the Africanized honey
        bee (AHB) in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin
        Islands.  The data indicate the year in which the AHB was first observed
        in a county.  This map layer was previously distributed as Spread of
        Africanized Bees in the United States.  This is a revised version of the
        March 2006 map layer.
      Purpose:
        These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the
        national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be
        displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data.
        No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United States
        in the use of these data.

      Process_Step:
        Process_Description:
          The ARS data were received in a variety of formats, and included
          information for the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin
          Islands.  The ARS reports identified the year and the counties in
          which Africanized honey bees were reported.  Working in ArcGIS, Atlas-
          Cnty, a shapefile of the county boundaries, was modified to include a
          Year attribute which was then populated with the information from ARS
          indicating when Africanized bees were first observed in a county.
          Counties where Africanized honey bees have not been observed were all
          given a Year value of 0.  The result was saved as a new shapefile.

          The ARS06 data were received as a PDF file.  Using ARS06 as a reference,
          ATLAS-Bees04 was edited in ArcView to reflect new observations for 2004
          and 2005, as well as corrections for New Mexico.  The result was saved
          as a new shapefile.
